# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your BidVerse frontend is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment.

## What's Been Configured:

1. **Package.json**: Added deployment scripts
   - `npm run predeploy`: Builds the project
   - `npm run deploy`: Deploys to GitHub Pages

2. **Vite Config**: Updated for GitHub Pages compatibility
   - Added base path configuration for production builds

3. **GitHub Actions**: Created CI/CD workflow
   - Automatically builds and deploys on push to main branch

## How to Deploy:

### Option 1: Manual Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Option 2: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to the `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy

## GitHub Repository Settings:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
3. Set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select **gh-pages** branch
5. Click **Save**

## Your Site URL:
Once deployed, your site will be available at:
`https://[your-username].github.io/BidVerse-A-Bidding-Website-main/`

## Troubleshooting:

- If deployment fails, check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
- Ensure your repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
- The first deployment might take a few minutes

## Local Testing:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Happy deploying! ðŸš€
